          mistake), the accountability will be completely on the customer to
          reach The Men’s Kompany again to schedule another return process. If

          process, we will be sending the same package back to your location. In
          both events, your return request will get ended within 20 days of our
          picking up the package for return. However, we won’t be responsible

          gracefully accept our decision for the return validation, i.e., if the
          requested product qualifies for return or not. Invalid returns will be
          reverted to the customer/s, get added to our backlist, and will be
          ineligible for future purchases. If a customer repeatedly refuses COD
          orders, it will lead to disqualification from the COD facility for
          him/her. If a customer asks for repeated returns of products, i.e.,
          more than 50% of the delivered products, every future order will be
          non-cancellable and non-returnable. All future orders will be
          processed under these conditions.
